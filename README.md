# [Onaji](http://onaji.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Whereas a medium size, multi-day event (like say, a hackathon) would have a Twitter for real-time updates, a Piazza for Q&A, and paper fliers or a static website for an event schedule, **Onaji** provides one standardized interface for all of these activities. The service can also send updates out to attendee's cell phones and email addresses.

Google translate tells us that **Onaji** means "same" in Japanese. **Onaji** gets event planners and participants on the same page, providing commonly used separate services in one unified interface.
